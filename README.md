# Title: Human Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for diagnosing diseases based on user-provided symptoms using machine learning techniques. With the rapid advancements in AI and the increasing reliance on data-driven solutions, this system aims to bridge the gap between healthcare accessibility and technology.

The core functionality revolves around users entering their symptoms through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The system processes this input using the Random Forest algorithm, a robust and widely-used machine learning model known for its high accuracy in classification tasks. By leveraging pre-existing medical datasets, the model predicts the potential disease with impressive accuracy.

Key features include:

Ease of Use: Designed for non-technical users with a simple GUI for symptom input.
High Accuracy: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for precise disease prediction.
Accessibility: Enables users to get an initial diagnosis from the comfort of their home.
Healthcare Support: Assists healthcare professionals by providing preliminary diagnostic suggestions.
This project demonstrates the transformative impact of machine learning in the medical field, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for disease prediction. Future expansions include migrating the system to a web or mobile platform, integrating real-time data updates, and enhancing the model to cover a broader range of diseases.

## Problem statement 
Current healthcare systems rely heavily on physical consultations for disease diagnosis, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Existing diagnostic systems lack the capability to detect subtypes of diseases and often yield less accurate results. There is a need for a system that leverages Machine Learning to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce dependency on in-person consultations, and provide quick and reliable predictions based on symptoms.
## About the project
The Human Disease Prediction System uses Machine Learning to predict diseases based on symptoms entered by the user. This system employs the Random Forest algorithm for higher accuracy and utilizes Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. By analyzing user-provided symptoms, the system offers precise disease predictions, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.
## Target Audience
Patients: Individuals seeking quick and initial assessments of their symptoms without visiting a doctor.
Healthcare Professionals: Doctors and clinics looking for a supplemental diagnostic tool to enhance decision-making.
Tech Enthusiasts: Developers and researchers interested in exploring the intersection of AI and healthcare.
## Technical implemntaion 
The system is built using Python and machine learning methodologies:

Data Preprocessing: Leveraging existing datasets from hospitals to prepare data for analysis.
Model Training: Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm for its classification capabilities.
User Interface: Creating an interactive interface with Tkinter for users to input symptoms.
Prediction: The trained model processes input data and predicts the most probable disease.
Output: Displaying the disease along with prediction accuracy.

## Declaration
We confirm that the project showcased here was either developed entirely during the hackathon or underwent significant updates within the hackathon timeframe. We understand that if any plagiarism from online sources is detected, our project will be disqualified, and our participation in the hackathon will be revoked.
## Note:
we have used some bootstrap things to create website as we are new to frontend and we took images source from the google. Also the dataset is not accurate as we created  our own due to lack of bio techincal person in our team.
